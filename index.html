      <p>When I became pregnant I started creating little things for my daughter. I would like to share one that is special for me: an embroidery of the night sky as it was on the date she was born, mounted in a wooden hoop to hang in her nursery. I now can create unique machine embroideries with your little one's name, date of birth, the stars and constellations in the position they were the day, time and location of your kids birth. They are My Little Stars!</p>

      <h2>Cygus</h2>
      <h5>18th November, 2018</h5>
      <div class="img"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/img017.jpg" class="rounded" alt="Swans"></div>
      <p>Cygnus is one of the constellations my father showed me when I was little. I treasure those moments of looking together at the stars while he told me the mythology behind them and it's a large part of why I created My Little Stars when decorating my little girl's room. I now want to share with you all this so you too can create magical moments together.</p>
      <p>It’s a northern constellation lying on the plane of the Milky Way, deriving its name from the Latinized Greek word for swan. The swan is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, and it features a prominent asterism known as the Northern Cross. Contains one of the brightest stars (Deneb) and one of the biggest (NML Cygni). In Greek mythology, Cygnus has been identified with several different legendary swans. Zeus disguised himself as a swan to seduce Leda, Spartan king Tyndareus' wife, who gave birth to the Gemini, Helen of Troy, and Clytemnestra;[1] Orpheus was transformed into a swan after his murder, and was said to have been placed in the sky next to his lyre (Lyra); and the King Cygnus was transformed into a swan.</p>
      <p>The Greeks also associated this constellation with the tragic story of Phaethon, the son of Helios the sun god, who demanded to ride his father's sun chariot for a day. Phaethon, however, was unable to control the reins, forcing Zeus to destroy the chariot (and Phaethon) with a thunderbolt, causing it to plummet to the earth into the river Eridanus. According to the myth, Phaethon's brother, Cycnus, grieved bitterly and spent many days diving into the river to collect Phaethon's bones to give him a proper burial. The gods were so touched by Cycnus' devotion to his brother that they turned him into a swan and placed him among the stars.</p>

      <h2>Pegasus</h2>
      <h5>8th November, 2018</h5>
      <div class="img"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/img007.jpg" class="rounded" alt="Pegasus"></div>
      <p>Pegasus is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the winged horse with magical powers Pegasus in Greek mythology. One myth regarding his powers says that, being friend of the Muses, his hooves dug out a spring, Hippocrene, which blessed those who drank its water with the ability to write poetry.</p>
      <p>Pegasus was the one who delivered Medusa's head when Perseus cut it off, after which he travelled to Mount Olympus in order to be the bearer of thunder and lightning for Zeus. He also became the horse to Bellerophon, who killed the Chimera with the help of Athena and Pegasus.</p>
      <p>In Chinese astronomy, the modern constellation of Pegasus lies in The Black Tortoise of the north. It is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a snake, both thought to be spiritual creatures symbolizing longevity.</p>
      <p>In Hindu astronomy, the Great Square of Pegasus represented a bedstead that was a resting place for the Moon.</p>
